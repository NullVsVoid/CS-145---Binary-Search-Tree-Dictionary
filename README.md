# Binary Search Tree Dictionary Application

A Java application for managing a dictionary of records using a binary search tree. This application facilitates adding, deleting, modifying, and looking up records in a structured and efficient manner.

## Description

This application provides a console-based interface for interacting with a binary search tree (BST) dictionary. Users can add new records, delete existing ones, modify record details, and perform lookups in various traversal orders. The BST structure ensures that records are kept in sorted order, allowing for efficient searches and modifications. The dictionary supports records containing personal information such as names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers.

## Features

- Efficient management of records using a binary search tree.
- Addition of new records to the dictionary.
- Deletion of records based on last name.
- Modification of existing record details.
- Lookup of records with options for pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal.
- Display of all records in sorted order.
- Console-based user interface with simple navigation and interaction.
